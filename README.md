# Effectcam
A program to place effects on your face in live feed

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS VERY HEAVY (takes 60% on an i5) SO BE WARNED

# Usage

Download the zip or clone git

Then run the python file. To choose an image change the code in line 13

```joker = cv2.imread('trollface_PNG6.png')```

This program is still a bit messed up
